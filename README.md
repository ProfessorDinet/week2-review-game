Week 2 Study Guide - Application/System Interaction & Abstraction
Unit Focus:
How applications and the operating system (OS) interact with hardware (H.CS.1A).


How abstraction hides complexity in computing systems and everyday devices (H.CS.1B).



Key Vocabulary (with Answers)
Application Software: Programs that help users perform tasks (Word, TikTok, Chrome).


System Software (Operating System): Software that manages hardware and lets applications run (Windows, iOS, Linux).


Hardware: Physical parts of a computer system (CPU, RAM, keyboard, printer).


Abstraction: Hiding unnecessary details and showing only what the user needs.


Embedded System: A computer built into another device (microwave, smartwatch, car system).



Notes Section (Completed)
Layers of a Computing System


Application Software → User-facing programs (Word, TikTok).


Operating System → Translates requests from apps into instructions for hardware.


Hardware → Executes the commands (CPU, printer, speakers).


Example: Printing a Document


Step 1: App (Word) sends request to Operating System.


Step 2: OS uses printer drivers to prepare the printer.


Step 3: Printer (hardware) prints the document on paper.


Abstraction Examples


Smartphone Camera → You tap “Take Picture.”


Hidden: Lens focus, light sensors, CPU image processing, file storage.


Microwave → You press “1 Minute.”


Hidden: Magnetron power, timer circuits, motor rotation, voltage regulation.


Car Steering Wheel → You turn left.


Hidden: Steering column, hydraulic/electric steering system, wheels adjusting.



Review Questions with Answers
What is the main job of the Operating System?


To manage hardware, run system processes, and allow applications to work with the hardware.


Why can’t applications run without system software?


Because apps need the OS to translate user commands into hardware instructions.


Define abstraction in your own words:


Abstraction hides complex details and shows only what the user needs to see.


Give one tech example of abstraction and explain what’s hidden.


Example: Google Search.


Hidden: Billions of servers, search algorithms, ranking systems.


Give one non-tech example of abstraction and explain what’s hidden.


Example: Light switch.


Hidden: Wires, electrical circuits, voltage regulation.


Why is abstraction important in computing?


It makes technology user-friendly, lets programmers focus on higher-level tasks, and allows users to use systems without needing to understand every detail.



Practice Tasks with Example Answers
Diagram Activity
 Layers:


App: Spotify → OS: Windows/Android → Hardware: Speakers.
 Flow:


User presses “Play” → OS translates → Speakers produce sound.


Scenario Analysis
 Device: ATM


What the user sees: Insert card, enter PIN, select withdrawal.


Hidden details: Secure communication with bank servers, encryption of PIN, database updates, mechanical cash dispenser.


Exit Slip Prep
 Be ready to answer:


“Where is the OS involved in the process you described?”


Example: In playing music, the OS translates the app’s command into instructions for the audio driver and sound card.
